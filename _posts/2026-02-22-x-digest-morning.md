Highlights from the X timeline — February 22, 2026.

## 🤖 AI & Coding Agents

### IDE Tool Evolution Cycle — @thdxr
> "in the past year: 1. everyone using cursor → 2. switched to claude code → 3. opencode is smarter → 4. codex is the future → 5. lol never switched off cursor"

💬37 🔁10 ❤️500 · [Link](https://x.com/thdxr/status/2025543565246414877)

A spot-on summary of the coding agent hype cycle. Cursor's resilience is notable — despite every new shiny tool, it keeps pulling people back.

### Gemini 3.1 Pro Goes Skeuomorphic — @MengTo
> "Gemini 3.1 Pro is so freaking good at making skeuomorphic user interfaces and animating them"

💬55 🔁76 ❤️1.3K · [Link](https://x.com/MengTo/status/2025508242546413899)

1.3K likes tells you vibe coding is still red hot. Gemini's UI generation capabilities are turning heads.

### 🔥 ByteDance CoT as Molecular Structure — @BoWang87
> "Bytedance dropped a paper that might change how AI thinks. They figured out why LLMs fail at long reasoning — framed it as chemistry. Chain-of-thought as molecular structure."

💬92 🔁521 ❤️2.3K · [Link](https://x.com/BoWang87/status/2025227673820176689)

The week's hottest tweet. ByteDance modeling CoT as molecular structure, with Nando de Freitas personally retweeting. Directly relevant to post-training research.

### NanoClaw Hits 10.5K Stars — @rohanpaul_ai
> "NanoClaw, lightweight alternative to OpenClaw, reached 10.5K Github stars."

💬56 🔁120 ❤️959 · [Link](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/2025267989952831958)

The minimalist approach (4K lines, container-based) is resonating. OpenClaw ecosystem competition is heating up.

## 🚀 Build in Public

### Human-AI Collaboration vs Full Automation — @yangyi
> "公众号自动化不难，难的是寻找高价值信息源、写Skills让AI协同、有品味地审核。"

The real insight: the hard part isn't automation — it's curation and taste. Human-in-the-loop remains the differentiator.
